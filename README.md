#  Optimising Online Sports Revenue

## Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze product-level data for an online sports retail company and generate insights that can optimize revenue and improve decision-making for sales and marketing strategies.

We work with datasets containing product details, pricing, revenue, brand info, user traffic, and customer reviews. By leveraging SQL, we uncover trends, correlations, and strategic opportunities to increase profitability.

## Tools & Technologies Used
###SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)

###SQL (Advanced Queries, Window Functions, CTEs, Joins)

###Data Types: Strings, Floats, Timestamps

###Functions Used: Aggregate, Date, Correlation, Subqueries, Window Functions

## Dataset Description
| Table     | Description                                           |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `info`    | Product name and description                          |
| `finance` | Pricing, discounts, revenue, and number of units sold |
| `reviews` | Ratings and number of reviews                         |
| `traffic` | Last visited timestamps                               |
| `brands`  | Brand name for each product                           |

## Analysis & Insights
This is your core section. Use subheadings for each analysis task:

### 1. Performed Data Integrity Checks  
### 2. Brand Pricing Comparison and Respective Sales
### 3. Revenue by Price Category 
### 4. Discount Trends and thr Impact of Discount

## Key Recommendations
###Focus on expanding inventory in high-margin categories: Expensive and Elite.

###Experiment with discount strategies — reduce discounts on high-performing footwear and apply limited-time offers on clothing.

###Increase customer reviews through post-purchase incentives — reviews positively influence revenue.

###Maintain continuous monitoring of product performance segmented by category, season, and brand.

###Leverage seasonal patterns in traffic and reviews to plan campaigns and inventory.

## Business Impact
By combining advanced SQL techniques with retail domain logic, this project delivers actionable insights to:

###Increase product profitability

###Balance discounting with volume-based sales

###Optimize inventory and pricing across different customer segments

###Inform marketing teams about review-based engagement strategies
